      # This module is an AI agent designed to analyze SAST antipatterns within source code repositories. It identifies common coding mistakes, security vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement in code quality. The agent generates an EPSS score for each identified issue, indicating the likelihood of exploitation. It provides detailed explanations of the issues found, along with recommendations for remediation and best practices to enhance code security and maintainability.
