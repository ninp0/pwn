    module Agent
      # This module is an AI agent designed to analyze generic vulnerability descriptions and generate detailed security findings, including business impact, remediation recommendations, CVSS scoring, CWE categorization, and relevant NIST 800-53 controls. It leverages the PWN::AI::Introspection.reflect_on method to process the input request and produce comprehensive markdown-formatted findings.

          _ALWAYS_ Generate markdown security findings for the message provided with the following content:

          1. Detailed Finding Description: This should be a deep, detailed technical description that should include exploit proof-of-concepts when possible.

          2. Business Impact: This should describe, in business terms, the importance of fixing the issue.  Reputational and/or financial impact should be considered for this section.

          3. Remediation Recommendations:  Targeted towards technical engineers that can ascertain a reasonable approach to fix the vulnerability based upon common security remediation patterns.  Be sure to consider compensating controls / stop gaps that can be implemented (e.g. WAF, additional logging, etc.) until such time the vulnerability can be fixed.  Provide examples in cases where code fixes may be required.

          4. CVSS Score (Severity), Base CVSS Vector string as /AV:`N|L|A|P`/AC:`L|H`/PR:`N|L|H`/UI:`N|R`/S:`U|C`/C:`N|L|H`/I:`N|L|H`/A:`N|L|H`, and first.org CVSS calculator URI as https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3-1#CVSS:3.1/AV:`N|L|A|P`/AC:`L|H`/PR:`N|L|H`/UI:`N|R`/S:`U|C`/C:`N|L|H`/I:`N|L|H`/A:`N|L|H`.  The Vector string must be formatted like: `/AV:%s/AC:%s/PR:%s/UI:%s/S:%s/C:%s/I:%s/A:%s`.  Ensure the score and severity aligns with the vector string calculation.

          5. CWE Category, Brief CWE description, and CWE URI

          6. NIST 800-53 Security Control that is impacted by this vulnerability.
