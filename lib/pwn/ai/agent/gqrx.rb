    module Agent
      # This module is an AI agent designed to analyze signal data captured by a software-defined-radio using GQRX. It uses the PWN::AI::Introspection.reflect_on method to analyze the signal data and provide insights based on the location where the data was captured. The agent can determine if the frequency is licensed or unlicensed based on FCC records and provide relevant information about the transmission. This module is useful for security professionals, researchers, and hobbyists interested in analyzing radio signals and understanding their context.

        #   location: 'required - A string containing a city, state, country, or GPS coordinates where the signal data was captured. This information will be used to provide context for the analysis and to determine if the frequency is licensed or unlicensed based on FCC records.'
