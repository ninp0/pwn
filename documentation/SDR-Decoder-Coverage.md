# SDR decoder coverage and acceptance matrix

**Verdict: the “full protocol decode in all modules” requirement is not complete.**
A valid frame in one mode is useful implementation, not full coverage of the named protocol family.

Audit snapshot: **2026-09-09T20:20:02.204954+00:00**. This is a working-tree audit, not a release or a claim about HEAD. Other workers were changing decoders during review; the exact reviewed bytes are identified by SHA-256 in `/tmp/pwn-decoder-completion-matrix.json`, with retained text in `/tmp/pwn-decoder-audit-snapshot.json`. Later edits require delta review. The audit itself changes documentation only; it does not stage, commit, alter decoder code, or endorse unrelated pre-existing staged files.

## Inventory and evidence contract

Runtime enumeration of `PWN::SDR::Decoder::REGISTRY` yields **24 keys, 21 unique protocol modules**, plus shared **Base and DSP**. All **50 decoder/namespace source and spec files** were read, including `base_iq_spec.rb`, `dsp_native_spec.rb`, namespace registry and namespace spec. The machine ledger deduplicates file paths and records module-to-source/spec/aliases, acceptance IDs, supported and missing layers, rates, security/native boundaries and reviewed hashes. Ancillary fixture/build/integration material is recorded separately; merely hashing a binary fixture does not mean it was decoded.

Evidence labels in this document:

- **Implemented/partial:** path exists in the reviewed code, with the exact mode boundary below. This is not a passing conformance assertion.
- **Spec evidence:** the named spec actually asserts the described behavior; a reviewed spec is not an execution result.
- **Independent bits:** expected bytes/fields originate outside the receiver. Synthetic modulation remains synthetic even if the bits are independent.
- **Independent generated IQ:** another transmitter implementation generated the waveform. This demonstrates interoperability for that waveform, not over-air sensitivity.
- **Received IQ / synchronized symbols:** distinguish raw RF samples from already synchronized/channelized samples; the latter cannot validate missing acquisition/tracking.
- **Open:** an implementation, standard clause, field family, unsupported mode, missing oracle or measurement remains outstanding. An explicit rejection is good failure behavior, not fulfillment.

### Meaning of full and finite scope

The requirement is read as receive-side **RF input → acquisition/tracking → demodulation → framing/FEC/integrity → all advertised mode fields → plaintext payload/reassembly where available**, with truthful encrypted/no-key behavior, incremental delivery and measured throughput at the declared input rate. Detectors stay under `.detect` and cannot satisfy any payload row.

Each module below has finite acceptance IDs. They include the implemented mode set **and** missing adjacent modes/layers; they do not silently redefine “all modules” as “one example per module.” Family expansion rows are still OPEN until implemented or explicitly removed by the user. Optional modes in a radio standard are not necessarily mandatory for a conforming individual device, but remain **product-scope decisions** under an unqualified broad decoder name. Freeze standard edition, profile, direction, channel width/rate, security mode and all legal combinations in a checked-in manifest before calling a family complete. The proposed target combinations below are audit acceptance targets, not claims that every standard makes each mode mandatory.

An unqualified “every protocol ever called WiFi/RFID/ISM” has no finite historical/version boundary. This matrix therefore exposes that scope issue instead of silently excluding it: baseline modes and named expansion families are explicit; a pinned per-standard/per-device manifest is a required closure artifact. Proprietary or unavailable specifications are research blockers, not permission to invent field meanings.

### Universal acceptance gates (apply to every module/mode)

| ID | Required observable result | Current assessment |
|---|---|---|
| ALL-1 | Explicit capture source/format/rate; independent fixture provenance, hash and expected fields; exact public `.decode` path | Mixed. Several paths accept only bits, synchronized symbols, MPX or amplitude traces; these are not interchangeable with raw IQ. |
| ALL-2 | Acquisition, timing/carrier tracking, complete frame and all required FEC/CRC/parity checks; correct absent-integrity states | Many partial PHYs. A checksum-valid header or selected-bit CRC must not certify an entire payload. |
| ALL-3 | All declared field variants, lengths, reserved values, per-layer validity and bounded fragmented-message assembly | Broad semantic gaps remain in cellular, WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, paging and RFID. |
| ALL-4 | Plaintext interpreted only when clear or authenticated with caller-supplied keys; cipher/unknown states retained without guessed keys | Partly implemented. ZigBee supports supplied-key NWK/APS CCM; most encrypted families remain opaque. Lack of keys does not excuse missing clear PHY/header decoding. |
| ALL-5 | First frame/artifact visible before source EOF; arbitrary bytes/chunks identical to bulk; no invented EOF padding; cleanup/errors/cancel under blocked reads and callbacks | Shared runner has direct lifecycle evidence. Custom GPS/RTL433/RFID subprocess paths require separate guarantees; FDX-B replay emits after child completion. |
| ALL-6 | Finite negative matrix: bad sync/FEC/CRC/MIC, noise, partial samples/frame, invalid rate, loss and timeout; never decoded-success fallback | Broad regression coverage but not per-mode conformance. Bounded-distance FEC cannot reject every error beyond its correction radius. |
| ALL-7 | Pinned backend/version/license and real missing-backend failure; native path actually exercised when required | Optional paths are not uniformly exercised by the default suite. Pure Ruby and native acceleration are different claims. |
| ALL-8 | End-to-end replay sustaining configured samples/s, measured latency/memory/loss and callback budget on named hardware; separate live RF test | No all-module rate qualification. Kernel benchmarks alone do not close this gate. |

## Shared infrastructure matrix

Local evidence: `lib/pwn/sdr/decoder.rb`, `base.rb`, `dsp.rb`; `spec/lib/pwn/sdr/decoder_spec.rb`, `base_spec.rb`, `base_iq_spec.rb`, `dsp_spec.rb`, `dsp_native_spec.rb`; `lib/pwn/sdr/gqrx.rb` and `spec/lib/pwn/sdr/gqrx_spec.rb`.

| ID | Reviewed support | Acceptance / remaining gap |
|---|---|---|
| REGISTRY-1 | 24 aliases map to 21 modules; Base/DSP are autoloaded utilities, not extra protocols | Resolve every key, assert the target and `.decode`/`.detect` contract. `gprs → GSM` must not imply GPRS decoding; `ism/keyfob → RTL433` must not imply all devices or rolling-code plaintext. |
| BASE-1 | `run_native` s16le audio; `run_iq` cu8/cs8/cs16; explicit file/IO or RTL-SDR/HackRF/Pluto/Soapy selection | IQ format is `iq_format`, not the native RTL433 backend's `format`. Generic Base does not accept cf32, although GPS and RTL433 custom backends do. Verify integer scalar carry, actual descriptor rate and source ownership for every backend. |
| BASE-2 | Bounded producer/consumer queue; ordered JSONL/output flush then callback; EOF draining, single clean-EOF flush, worker error propagation | Reader error/cancel is not clean EOF. Prove incomplete sample failure, no flush on capture loss and no thread/FD leakage; existing focused specs cover these paths but not every protocol demodulator. |
| BASE-3 | Overrun/dropped-byte source status checked, discontinuity raises; unknown counts stay nil | Queue backpressure is not hardware-loss telemetry. Validate adapters on actual devices; UDP audio sequence/loss remains unmeasured. Do not report unknown loss as zero. |
| DSP-1 | Ruby fallback and optional DSPNative packed unpack/magnitude/FM, radix-2 FFT; FFTW/VOLK/Liquid helpers elsewhere | Numeric precision/scale, N versus N-1 FM samples, prior IQ and byte remainder must match across backends/chunks. Generic resampling/timing helpers do not establish continuous protocol tracking. |
| DSP-2 | Native kernel benchmark artifacts in `ext/pwn_dsp/` | Record selected backend and benchmark entire decode pipeline at each row's rate. Existing README explicitly says kernel-only rates omit acquisition/channelizer/protocol/queueing. |
| GQRX-1 | `init_freq` resolves registry and forwards common streaming controls; RDS `.sample` avoided when streaming requested | Current allowlist forwards source/file/sample_rate/chunk_bytes but drops protocol `mode`, `iq_format`, `backend`, native executable, modulation, channel/key/context options. Direct `.decode` successes are not GQRX end-to-end acceptance. Implement explicit validated per-decoder option forwarding and test every unique target. |
| NATIVE-1 | Optional native DSP/SCH and required native LTE bridge; custom native GPS/RDS/RTL433/RFID processes | Namespace comment “100% ruby-native / no external binary” is stale. State accurately: first-party Ruby coordination plus named C/C++ libraries/processes; external fixture generators are not runtime dependencies. If “native” means exclusively Ruby, these backends need an explicit requirement decision. |

### RF and performance requirements

Rates below are complex input samples/second unless labeled audio, symbols or chips. They are not RF center frequencies or occupied bandwidth. A 48 kHz GQRX audio stream cannot replace multi-Msps WiFi, BLE, LTE or ZigBee IQ, and cannot carry the 57 kHz RDS subcarrier. Higher rates require channelization/resampling, not relabeling metadata.

`ext/pwn_gsm/README.md` records a measured native SCH scanner plus DSP replay exceeding its 1.083333 Msps fixture workload; it explicitly limits that result to SCH replay. `ext/pwn_lte/benchmark-results.json` measures an acquired PBCH workload, not a full LTE bearer. `ext/pwn_dsp/benchmark-results.json` measures kernels, not decoders. These are repository artifacts reviewed, **not benchmarks rerun by this audit**. WiFi's 11/22/44 Msps Ruby reference path especially needs native end-to-end qualification before any realtime claim. TEMPEST upsampling cannot recreate missing RF bandwidth.

## Per-module acceptance matrix

Every row remains partial overall. Source and spec links are exact repository files; acceptance items are obligations, not completed checkboxes. External references identify the protocol baseline; local implementation findings come from the linked source, not from those standards.

## Prioritized independently implementable work

Priority orders risk and integration value; it is not a claim that later rows are optional. Assign disjoint protocol ownership, with a separate shared Base/GQRX owner.

| Priority / owner boundary | Concrete next deliverable | Acceptance gate / dependency |
|---|---|---|
| P0 Shared API owner | Forward protocol mode/backend/format and context options through GQRX; expose machine-readable capability records | GQRX-1, REGISTRY-1. Test all aliases programmatically; do not silently route a GPS/LTE IQ mode to defaults. |
| P0 Integrity/schema owner with protocol reviews | Uniform layer/capability/source/backend/integrity/encryption states; update stale pure-Ruby/default help claims | ALL-2/4. Preserve valid MAC/PHY output when upper-layer authentication fails, but never label it decoded application plaintext. |
| P0 Measurement owner | Versioned per-mode standards/backend manifest, fixture oracles and loss/rate qualification | ALL-1/7/8. Freeze repository snapshot before full gates; a moving tree cannot be certified by one test run. |
| P1 GSM owner | Normal-burst equalizer + xCCH/FIRE/FEC + BCCH/CCCH/LAPDm/RR; then GPRS alias | GSM-2/3. Independent SCH already exists; implement traffic independently from scanner speedups. |
| P1 LTE owner | PBCH variants/tracking/combining, then PDCCH/PDSCH SI-RNTI → SIB/RRC | LTE-2/3. Native bridge scope stays explicit; no MIB-only “LTE complete” claim. |
| P1 GPS owner | Native IQ fixture execution and complete LNAV fields/ephemeris/clock/page assembly | GPS-1/2; PVT separate. The newly integrated process path must be tested with actual IQ, not only monitor words. |
| P1 Iridium owner | Raw burst acquisition/timing/CFO then non-IRA frame families and reassembly | IRIDIUM-2/3. Pre-synchronized symbol captures only close an IRA downstream boundary. |
| P1 WiFi owner | Native rate-qualified DSSS frontend, DQPSK/CCK, OFDM; MAC semantic/reassembly owner can work independently | WIFI-1/2/3. Keep PHY packet delivery contract stable. |
| P1 Bluetooth owner | Connection/hop/AUX tracking and L2CAP/ATT; separate LE2M/coded and BR/EDR frontends | BLUETOOTH-1/2/3. Supplied-AA single-channel frames are not tracked connections. |
| P1 P25 owner | Finish PDU family/TSBK semantics and voice/link-control; independent CQPSK/Phase2 owner | P25-1/2/3. New unconfirmed PDU has header/packet checks, not all PDU modes. |
| P1 DECT owner | Bearer/multiframe state + DLC/NWK + remaining B protection/packet families | DECT-1/2/3. Caller frame_number/format is not automatic connection decoding. |
| P1 ZigBee upper-layer owner | APS fragments, ZDP/ZCL commands/attributes, replay/key-context policies | ZIGBEE-2/3. MAC CCM and alternate PHYs can be separate tasks; supplied-key NWK CCM already exists. |
| P1 Catalogue/RFID owner | Pinned rtl_433 all-device inventory; separate LF/HF/UHF RFID manifests/frontends | RTL433-1 and RFID-2/3. Installed catalogue/external client availability does not prove every advertised mode. |
| P2 Paging owner | FLEX long-address/message variants + independent all-rate POCSAG/Pager IQ cases | FLEX-1/2/3, POCSAG-1/2/3, PAGER-1/2/3. Preserve message-level integrity. |
| P2 Broadcast owner | Complete RDS group/ODA schema and IQ→MPX; APT Sync-B/telemetry/drift/calibration | RDS-1/2/3, APT-1/2/3. Group14A/PGM output alone are insufficient. |
| P2 Narrowband owner | Correct raw CW/FSK frontend and public RTTY mode parameters, all alphabet/timing fixtures | MORSE-1/2/3, RTTY-1/2/3. Existing synthetic audio and generic FM IQ are different input classes. |
| P2 LoRa owner | Fractional CFO/clock drift and full legal parameter grid; separate LoRaWAN semantics | LORA-1/2/3. Expanded SF/header/CRC modes are present, not all combinations independently demonstrated. |
| P2 Image owner | TEMPEST timing/origin acquisition and independent display-pattern evidence | TEMPEST-1/2/3. Fix exact pixel-clock handling; never certify arbitrary magnitude rasters as actual screens. |
| P2 ADSB owner | Missing TC/status/DF18 semantics; separate Mode-S AP/DP and UAT frontend | ADSB-1/2/3. Existing CPR/altitude expansion is not all surveillance messages. |

## Verification performed and remaining evidence

- Runtime registry enumeration completed using direct namespace loading: 24 aliases, 21 unique values. No radio selected.
- Executed `bundle exec rspec spec/lib/pwn/sdr/decoder_spec.rb spec/lib/pwn/sdr/decoder/base_spec.rb spec/lib/pwn/sdr/decoder/dsp_spec.rb` in `/opt/pwn`: **44 examples, 0 failures**. This verifies only that focused run; it is not a protocol-completeness metric.
- An earlier process launched from the research interpreter had a different gem environment and failed Bundler dependency materialization. The actual terminal environment ran the focused specs successfully. No package installation or lockfile changes were made by this audit.
- All module/spec inventory and acceptance-ID coverage are checked programmatically against `REGISTRY.values.uniq`; source/spec hashes identify what was read. No fabricated decoded frames or measurements are used.
- No full `rake`, complete optional-native matrix, sensitivity test or live RF test was run by this documentation audit. Full gates can regenerate module skills and concurrent implementation was active; run them after integration settles. Neither this limitation nor a future green suite resolves the OPEN acceptance rows.
- Citation retrieval used direct HTTP and PDF text extraction because the configured web extractor was search-only. NOAA's old APT host failed DNS; the NOAA KLM guide was retrieved instead. Semtech's product page timed out; LoRa mode/synchronization context uses the retrieved independent implementation reference, not an unread manufacturer datasheet. The RDS commercial catalogue page was insufficient for clause-level claims; use the actual redsea reference and a pinned licensed standard for final conformance.

### Required completion artifacts

For every acceptance ID, attach a pinned standard clause/profile, supported-mode list, public entry-point command, source/fixture hash, independent expected decoded fields, negative/ciphertext outcomes, actual execution result, and end-to-end rate/latency evidence. Preserve unsupported variants and unavailable sources as OPEN. A finite catalogue row needs every pinned device ID, including disabled-by-default entries; a finite standard row needs every declared message/PHY combination, not an illustrative subset.

This document is exhaustive over the current registry and reviewed files, **not a declaration of exhaustive protocol conformance**. It intentionally does not claim completion from a test count.
